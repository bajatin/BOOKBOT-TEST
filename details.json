    "description": "The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo.\n\nA young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver\u2019s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 \u2014\u201cQ is for \u2018question mark.\u2019 A world that bears a question.\u201d Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. \n\nAs Aomame\u2019s and Tengo\u2019s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.\n\nA love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell\u2019s \u2014 1Q84 is Haruki Murakami\u2019s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.",
